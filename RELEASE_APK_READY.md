## ⚠️ CRITICAL: BACKUP YOUR KEYSTORE!

**🔴 EXTREMELY IMPORTANT 🔴**

Your signing keystore is located at:

```
D:\5th Sem. Lab\SHAKTIAI-YUVAI\shakti-release-key.jks
```

**YOU MUST BACKUP THIS FILE!**

**Why?**

- Without it, you can NEVER update your app on Play Store
- If you lose it, you'll have to create a completely new app
- Users will have to uninstall and reinstall (lose all data)

**Where to Backup:**

1. ✅ External USB drive (encrypted)
2. ✅ Cloud storage (Google Drive, with encryption)
3. ✅ Password manager (1Password, LastPass)
4. ✅ Multiple locations (redundancy)

**Also backup:**

```
- shakti-release-key.jks (the keystore file)
- keystore.properties (the passwords)
```
