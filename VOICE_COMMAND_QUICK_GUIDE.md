3. Opens Dashboard → Go to "AI Monitoring"
4. Toggle "Enable Voice Commands"
5. Click "Test Voice" button

## Secret Codes (Calculator App)

- **999=** → Open Dashboard (main app interface)
- **911=** → Manual SOS trigger (instant emergency)
- **777=** → Open Settings

---

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Commands Not Working?

**Check These:**

1. Is the green dot visible? (protection must be enabled)
2. Did you grant microphone permission?
3. Are you saying "HELP" loudly enough?
4. Is battery optimization disabled for the app?

**To Fix:**

- Go to Settings (type `777=`)
- Check all permissions are granted
- Disable battery optimization
- Restart the app and try again

### False Triggers (Accidental Activation)

**This is Rare Because:**

- Requires 3 distinct "HELP" commands
- Must be within 8 seconds
- Requires loud vocal energy
- Background noise filtered out

**If It Happens:**

- Cancel within 5 seconds
- Or let it record (better safe than sorry)

## Where Are My Recordings?

### Important: Files Are Hidden On Purpose!

**Why Hidden?**

- Security: Attacker can't find and delete evidence
- Privacy: Won't show up in gallery if someone checks your phone
- Disguise: Maintains the calculator app cover

**How to Access Evidence:**

1. Open Dashboard (type `999=`)
2. Go to "Evidence" or "Incident Reports"
3. View/export recordings from there

**File Location (Technical):**

```
Internal App Storage (Hidden):
/data/data/com.shakti.ai/files/.system_cache/

Files look like:
- sys_front_20241118_143022.dat (front camera)
- sys_back_20241118_143022.dat (back camera)
- sys_audio_[id]_20241118_143022.dat (audio)
```

## Emergency Contact Setup

### To Ensure Alerts Work:

2. Add Emergency Contacts
3. Enter phone numbers
4. Verify contacts receive test message

**When Emergency Triggered:**
